## Introduction

The PS4 has been a popular gaming console since its release, but like any system, it has its vulnerabilities. This project explores those vulnerabilities to help developers and researchers understand how to exploit them. Our goal is to provide a reliable and effective method for running unsigned code on the PS4 9.00 firmware.

The repository includes a WebKit exploit that leverages existing vulnerabilities in the browser engine. Additionally, the Lapse kernel exploit allows deeper access to the system's resources. This work is ongoing, and we welcome contributions from the community.
